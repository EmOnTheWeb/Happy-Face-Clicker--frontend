	    <p>This Happy Face Clicker is modeled on the 'attention training game' featured on the BBC Horizon documentary <span class="italic">Rainy Brain Sunny Brain</span>. By searching for the smiley face, train the mind to disengage from the frowning faces and focus on the positive. Through habituation, this creates a positive attention bias and improves a sense of wellbeing.</p>

		<p>The game was originally developed by Dr Mark Baldwin at McGill University in Canada.</p>

		<p>The website needs more faces! If you would like to contribute your face, frown or smile, please send images to <a href="mailto:happyfaceclicker@gmail.com">happyfaceclicker@gmail.com</a>. We especially need frowns! But please make sure the frown is a frown and not a smile because otherwise the game becomes confusing and ineffectual. Don't hesitate to email if you'd like your face taken down.</p> 

		<p class="instructions"><span>How to play:</span> find and click the smiley face. Repeat.</p>
